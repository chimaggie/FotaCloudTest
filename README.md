===========================

Source code to support the free Online course Start Using Selenium WebDriver with Java

You can find the Free Online course here:

[http://seleniumsimplified.com/get-started/ "Free course start-using-selenium-webdriver-with-java")

The source code has only really been uploaded in case people encounter problems following the instructions or make a very simple mistake that they cannot figure out.

The code has changed slightly because we now need to do a .close and a .quit to exit Firefox

And I've updated the version of WebDriver.
